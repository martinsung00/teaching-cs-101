/*
  You have two numbers, each represented by a linked list, where each node contains a single digit. The digits are stored in _reverse_ order, such that the 1's place is the last node. Implement an algorithm that adds the two numbers and returns the sum as a linked list.

  Input: 7 -> 1 -> 6 (617) 5 -> 9 -> 2 (295)
  Output: 2 -> 1 -> 9 (912)

  Î±.

  Note: a common follow-up is to re-implement the algorithm supposing that the digits were stored in _forward_ order.
