/*
  Implement an algorithm that evaluates fully parenthesized arithmetic expressions that conform to the following grammatical rules:
  
  1. Operators, operands, and parentheses are separated by whitespace.
  2. Each operation must be enclosed in parentheses.
  3. Valid operators include: "+", "-", "*", "/", and "sqrt".
  4. Valid operands include all non-negative integers.
  
  For example, you will need to write:
  "( 1 + ( 2 + 3 ) )", instead of:
  "( 1 + 2 + 3 )"

  You can assume that the input will follow the above format.

  Input: "( 1 + ( ( 2 + 3 ) * ( 4 * 5 ) ) )"
  Output: 101.0

  Input: "( ( 1 + sqrt ( 5 ) ) / 2.0 )"
  Output: 1.618033988749895
