/*
  Computing Prime Numbers

  A common type of computation is the generate-and-test method, in which one systematically generates potential solutions to a problem, and then applies a sequence of one or more tests to determine if the proposed solution is in fact valid.
  
  While one could in principle (and under some circumstances one must) generate potential solutions randomly or according to some probability distribution, often it is more efficient to devise a systematic method for generating all candidate solutions.
